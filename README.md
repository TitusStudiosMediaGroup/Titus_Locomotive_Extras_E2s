What does this mean?
My E2 is now publicly available for use. The version found on here should be stable, however, there is always the chance that some bugs may remain in the code. Future updates are certain, and you will need to update your locomotives as time goes by. That means updating E2s, re-wiring dupes.


## To Install (The *Apparently* Hard Way, since so many people screw it up):

1. Click the "Clone or Download" button on the righthand side of the screen and select "Download Zip."
2. Open the Zip file using a program like WinZip or WinRar, if it didn't open automatically.
3. Navigate __INTO__ the "Titus_Locomotive_Extras_E2s" Folder.
4. Extract the folder directly into: `<Your active steam directory>\SteamApps\common\Garry's Mod\garrysmod\data\expression2\`.
The file path should then look like `expression2\Titus_Locomotive_Extras_E2s\...`.

You will also need **ALL** Of Titus's Garrys Mod Addons *(Yes all)* for it to work correctly. There are five:

If you're currently in-game in Garry's Mod, open the E2 Editor, and click the "Update" button under the list of E2s on the lefthand side of the window.

These E2s are made in my own time, by myself, and with my own learning. As part of me relasing some of my Expression 2s publicly, it would mean the world to me if you could help me in return. One way you can contribue is to follow my social media, or send me any errors with my e2s or code. Thank you, you are all very dare to me.
